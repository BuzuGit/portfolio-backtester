Making Future Changes:

  Whenever you want to add features or make changes:

  1. Open this folder in Claude Code
  2. Tell me what you want
  3. I'll make the changes
  4. Run npm run dev to test locally
  5. When happy, I'll push to GitHub → Vercel auto-deploys

  That's it! The whole update process takes just a few minutes.
